# SpamFilter
This is just a proof of concept for a sms spam filer using machine learning and Naive Bayes classifiers. 
It was tested with the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?select=spam.csv).
With simple changes it can be used for any binary classification problem.
